# Introduction
---
- Dalitz-plot was originallly used to determine the spin and parity of light mesons
- Recently, Dalitz-plot analyses have emerged as a powerful tool in the study of $$D$$ and $$B$$ mesons  
- Dalitz-plot analysis technique can be used to analyse process that multi-body decays of charmonium to all hadronic final states.

- a spin-0 particle decay to three pseudo-scalar final states: $$D,B \rightarrow abc$$
    - the dacay rate:
    $$
    \Gamma=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^3 32\sqrt{s^3}}|M|^2 dm^2_{ab}dm^2_{bc}
    $$
$$m_{ij}$$ is the invariant mass of $$i-j$$, the coefficient of the amplitude includes all kinematic factors
    - the scatter plot in $$m^2_{ab}$$ versus $$m^2_{bc}$$ is called a Dalitz-plot
