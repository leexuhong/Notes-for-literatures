# Introduction
- Dalitz-plot was originallly used to determine the spin and parity of light mesons
- Recently, Dalitz-plot analyses have emerged as a powerful tool in the study of $$D$$ and $$B$$ mesons  
- Dalitz-plot analysis technique can be used to analyse process that multi-body decays of charmonium to all hadronic final states.

---
- a spin-0 particle decay to three pseudo-scalar final states: $$D,B \rightarrow abc$$
